  abstract  = {Motivated by the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse domains, we present a novel hierarchical multi-agent collaborative framework leveraging LLMs to address time series forecasting challenges. Leveraging advanced prompting techniques including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), our system implements a multi-layer agent-based cooperative architecture comprising Forecast, Support, and Debate. The agents in the Forecast layer generate initial predictions, those in the Support layer refine them while the agents in the Debate layer perform critical evaluation. This structured cooperation allows LLMs to iteratively improve prediction quality and adapt to complex time series data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-layer collaborative multi-agent framework achieves promising accuracy and robustness compared to both traditional training-based models and existing LLM-based approaches in time series forecasting tasks.}

  abstract = {While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse domains, their application to code vulnerability detection holds great potential for identifying security flaws and improving software safety. In this paper, we propose a sequential multi-stage approach via confidence- and collaboration-based decision making (ConfColl). The system adopts a three-stage sequential classification framework, proceeding through a single agent, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with external examples, and multi-agent reasoning enhanced with RAG. The decision process selects among these strategies to balance performance and cost, with the process terminating at any stage where a high-certainty prediction is achieved. Experiments on a benchmark dataset and a low-resource language demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing code vulnerability detection performance.},

  abstract  = {As AI technology advances, early detection of code vulnerabilities becomes increasingly critical for preventing exploitation, reducing remediation costs, enhancing user trust, and improving system performance. Recently, Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks using few-shot learning. This study aims to adopt LLM-based agents in a multi-turn discussion framework enhanced with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy to improve response quality. Our multi-agent approach transforms a single LLM into a highly collaborative intelligence through multi-turn self-collaboration with diverse personas. By leveraging their combined expertise, this approach enhances the accuracy of code vulnerability detection and improves inference capabilities. To effectively utilize few-shot learning samples, we employ intra-references to extract a small number of similar samples from the training data, and inter-references to obtain samples from external data. The experimental studies are conducted on the TreeVul_Ext dataset, and our model achieves promising results across different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, we apply our model to detect code vulnerabilities in low-resource languages and exhibit competitive performance as well.}

  author = {Lin, Ching-Sheng and Tsai, Chung-Nan and Jwo, Jung-Sing and Lee, Cheng-Hsiung and Wang, Xin},
  abstract={Deep learning models have demonstrated their effectiveness in capturing complex relationships between input features and target outputs across many different application domains. These models, however, often come with considerable memory and computational demands, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Knowledge distillation is a prominent technique for transferring the expertise from an advanced yet heavy teacher model to a more efficient leaner student model. As ensemble methods have exhibited notable enhancements in model generalization and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various machine learning tasks, we adopt ensemble techniques to perform knowledge distillation from BERT using multiple lightweight student models. Our approach applies lean architectural paradigms of spatial and sequential networks including LSTM, CNN and their fusion to perform data processing from distinct perspectives. Instead of using contextual word representations which require more space in natural language processing applications, we take advantage of a single static pre-trained and low-dimensional word embedding space to be shared among student models. Empirical studies are conducted on the sentiment classification problem and our model outperforms not only other existing techniques but also the teacher model.},

  author    = {Lin, Ching-Sheng and Tsai, Chung-Nan and Su, Shao-Tang and Jwo, Jung-Sing and Lee, Cheng-Hsiung and Wang, Xin},
  abstract = {Large language models have recently gained popularity in various applications due to their ability to generate natural text for complex tasks. Recommendation systems, one of the frequently studied research topics, can be further improved using the capabilities of large language models to track and understand user behaviors and preferences. In this research, we aim to build reliable and transparent recommendation system by generating human-readable explanations to help users obtain better insights into the recommended items and gain more trust. We propose a learning scheme to jointly train the rating prediction task and explanation generation task. The rating prediction task learns the predictive representation from the input of user and item vectors. Subsequently, inspired by the recent success of prompt engineering, these predictive representations are served as predictive prompts, which are soft embeddings, to elicit and steer any knowledge behind language models for the explanation generation task. Empirical studies show that the proposed approach achieves competitive results compared with other existing baselines on the public English TripAdvisor dataset of explainable recommendations.},

  author    = {Tsai, Chung-Nan and Kirkici, Hulya},
  abstract={These Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as one of the promising electron-emitting materials available for use in cold cathode applications such as vacuum microelectronic devices. It has been shown that due to the high aspect ratio (small diameter and relatively long length) it is possible to obtain electron emission at a relatively low applied electric field. Because of this property, CNTs may play an important role when used as cold cathode material in plasma devices. In this work, the experimental results of field emission characteristics of CNTs fabricated using Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) are presented. The samples are selectively grown randomly oriented multi-walled CNTs (MWNTs) and synthesize onto plain silicon (n-type 100) substrates. A thin catalyst (Fe) film is first deposited by DC magnetron sputtering and high-quality films of MWNTs are grown in a thermal CVD furnace in a mixture of acetylene and argon gasses, after lithographic lift-off patterning of a metal catalyst layer on the wafer. The measurement results indicate that randomly oriented CNTs have significant field emission capabilities to be used as cold cathode emitters in plasma devices.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
