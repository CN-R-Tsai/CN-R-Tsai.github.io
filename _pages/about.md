## 👋 Hey there!
 
I’m Chung-Nan Tsai, a Software Developer and Data Scientist at Lam Research, based in Yokkaichi, in Japan’s dynamic Chubu region. I specialize in building interactive, user-focused web applications that empower stakeholders by visualizing key metrics and delivering actionable insights. My work also includes developing advanced AI chat agents powered by Large Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as multi-agent architectures that simulate expert reasoning and decision-making. These efforts drive digital transformation initiatives that elevate operational intelligence across the organization.

My work aims to push the boundaries of intelligent and trustworthy AI applications, particularly in smart manufacturing and equipment intelligence. I explore improving model generalization, creating explainable and controllable AI solutions, and ensuring the safe, reliable deployment of large language models. Additionally, I investigate multi-agent systems to enable coordinated collaboration, enhance automation, and support intelligent decision-making for improved operational efficiency.

With over eight years of engineering experience, I am passionate about designing data-driven tools that streamline workflows and enhance usability. My expertise spans Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Smart Manufacturing, Data Analytics, Web Application Development, and Customer Technical Support.

As an innovative team leader with a sharp sense of business priorities, I am motivated by transforming fast-evolving business goals into tangible, revenue-generating outcomes. Fluent in English, Japanese, and Chinese—with beginner proficiency in Korean—I bring a rich international perspective shaped by extensive global experience. I am authorized to work in both Japan and Taiwan, ready to contribute across diverse cultural and professional environments.

私は現在、機械学習をはじめとするAI技術を活用し、半導体製造装置の製造プロセスにおけるさまざまな課題の解決に取り組んでいます。特に、自律的に稼働する半導体製造装置の開発を中心に、装置の安定稼働と高い歩留まりの実現を目指しています。

半導体製造装置は非常に精密かつ複雑なため、トラブル発生時の原因特定が難しく、対応に多くの時間を要します。そこで、装置自身が異常の原因と場所を即座に判別し、適切な対応策を提案できるシステムの開発を進めています。この取り組みにより、現場の作業効率向上と停止時間の最小化を実現し、お客様により大きな価値を提供しています。

さらに、これらの技術を活用して製造現場のデジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）を推進するシステム構築にも注力しており、業務プロセスの効率化と高度化を通じて新たな価値創出を目指しています。

現在はまだ初期段階の研究開発ですが、将来的には完全メンテナンスフリーの自律型装置の実現を目標に、日々挑戦を続けています。
